# Landing Page Project
This project is an implementation for what we have learned in [DOM & Javascript interaction Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-and-the-dom--ud117).<br>
The goal is to add interactivity for the landing page by building navbar programmatically to anchor the sections & setting <br> 
active section when scrolling.

## Starter-Code
You can have a copy of the starter code of the project from [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page)
## Dependencies
I've done this project using the help of [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) & [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).<br><br>

## Project-Structure
The structure of the project as follow:
```
index.html
css
- styles.css
js
- app.js
README.md
```
inside our `js/app.js`, we built navbar programmatically to anchor the sections inside `index.html` & set <br>
active section when scrolling. we linked our `js/app.js` at the bottom of `body` element which exists in `index.html`.

## Run-App
You can run the project by simply navigating to the root directory of the project then open `index.html` <br>
with your favorite browser (chrome or firefox).
